# LinkedList


Welcome to my LinkedList. This one is a more logical program rather than more UI based. It is my attempt of creating a java data structure from stratch and with my own code. It implements my logic and has some functions that i wished LinkedLists would have. Feel free to add more things you want to LinkedLists to have!

To run each one either go to the link on the top of the file or if cloning just run each indivual file to play each game!
